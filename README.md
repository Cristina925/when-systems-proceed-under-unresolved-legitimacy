# When Systems Proceed Under Unresolved Legitimacy

Across sectors, a growing class of failures does not originate in intent, bias, or technical malfunction.  
They originate earlier — when systems proceed **as if authority, responsibility, or legitimacy were already resolved**, when they are not.

As automation increases and decisions accelerate, actions are increasingly executed **before it is clear who has the right to act, on whose behalf, and under what mandate**. Once executed, many of these actions are irreversible.

This creates a structural gap: systems may act correctly according to logic or policy, yet illegitimately according to authority.

## The Missing System Phase

Most operational models implicitly assume the following sequence:

**Trigger → Decision → Action → Review**

In practice, a critical phase is missing:

**Trigger → Context & Authority Recognition → Action → Evidence**

When this recognition phase is absent or implicit, systems proceed under assumed legitimacy.

## What “Unresolved Legitimacy” Means

A system proceeds under unresolved legitimacy when:

- The acting entity (human, system, or agent) is unclear  
- Authority is inferred, inherited, cached, or assumed  
- The principal on whose behalf action is taken is ambiguous  
- Delegation has not been explicitly recognised at the moment of action  
- The system cannot legitimately choose not to act  

This is not a question of optimisation or compliance.  
It is a question of **standing**.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Modern systems increasingly execute actions that are:

- Automated or agent-driven  
- Cross-jurisdictional  
- High-impact and irreversible  
- Audited only after the fact  

In these conditions, post-hoc explanations, policies, or logs are insufficient.  
What is missing is **contemporaneous recognition**: evidence that action was legitimate **at the moment it occurred**.

---

## A Neutral Recognition Statement

A minimal, non-prescriptive recognition can be expressed as:

> *At the moment this action was executed, authority to act had been explicitly recognised — or the system entered a recognised non-action state due to unresolved legitimacy.*

The absence of such recognition is itself material.

---

## What This Is — and Is Not

**This is:**
- A recognition of a missing system phase  
- A cross-domain observation (technology, finance, infrastructure, AI, governance)  
- A neutral framing suitable for regulatory, legal, and technical contexts  

**This is not:**
- Guidance or advice  
- A control, framework, or product  
- A recommendation on how systems should be built

## Why Recognition Precedes Solutions

Before optimisation, safety, or accountability can be addressed, systems must be able to answer a simpler question:

**Was this action allowed to happen at all?**

Where that cannot be shown, failure is not accidental — it is structural.

*This repository exists to name a pattern that is increasingly visible as systems accelerate.  
Recognition is the first step. Solutions, if any, come later.*
